Introduction to Loops
Suppose we want to print() each item from a list of dog_breeds. We would need to use the following code snippet:

dog_breeds = ['french_bulldog', 'dalmatian', 'shihtzu', 'poodle', 'collie']

print(dog_breeds[0])
print(dog_breeds[1])
print(dog_breeds[2])
print(dog_breeds[3])
print(dog_breeds[4])
This seems inefficient. Luckily, Python (and most other programming languages) gives us an easier way of using, or iterating through, every item in a list. We can use loops! A loop is a way of repeating a set of code many times.

In this lesson, weâ€™ll be learning about:

Loops that let us move through each item in a list, called for loops
Loops that keep going until we tell them to stop, called while loops
Loops that create new lists, called list comprehensions

Example:

dog_breeds = ['french_bulldog', 'dalmatian', 'shihtzu', 'poodle', 'collie']

for breed in dog_breeds:
    print(breed)
    
This will print each breed in dog_breeds.
