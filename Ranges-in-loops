Using Range in Loops

Often we won’t be iterating through a specific list, we’ll just want to do a certain action multiple times. For example, if we wanted to print out a "WARNING!" message three times, we would want to say something like:

for i in <a list of length 3>:
  print("WARNING!")
  
Notice that we need to iterate through a list of length 3, but we don’t care what’s in the list. To create these lists of length n, we can use the range function. range takes in a number n as input, and returns a list from 0 to n-1. For example:

zero_thru_five = range(6)
# zero_thru_five is now [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
zero_thru_one = range(2)
# zero_thru_one is now [0, 1]

So, an easy way to accomplish our "WARNING!" example would be:

for i in range(3):
  print("WARNING!")

example:
promise = "I will not chew gum in class"
for i in range(5):
  print(promise)
