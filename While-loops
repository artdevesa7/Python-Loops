While loops can be used to iterate through lists, just like for loops:

dog_breeds = ['bulldog', 'dalmation', 'shihtzu', 'poodle', 'collie']

index = 0
while index < len(dog_breeds):
  print(dog_breeds[index])
  index += 1
Every time the condition of the while loop (in this case, index < len(dog_breeds)) is satisfied, the code inside the while loop runs.

While loops can be useful when you donâ€™t know how many iterations it will take to satisfy a condition.

Example:
'''
You are adding students to a Poetry class, the size of which is capped at 6.
While the length of the students_in_poetry list is less than 6, use .pop() to 
take a student off the all_students list and add it to the students_in_poetry list.
'''
all_students = ["Alex", "Briana", "Cheri", "Daniele", "Dora", "Minerva", "Alexa", "Obie", "Arius", "Loki"]
students_in_poetry = []

while len(students_in_poetry) < 6:
  students_in_poetry.append(all_students.pop())
print(students_in_poetry)
