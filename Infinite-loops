Infinite Loops

We’ve iterated through lists that have a discrete beginning and end. However, let’s consider this example:

my_favorite_numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 42]

for number in my_favorite_numbers:
  my_favorite_numbers.append(1)
  
What happens here? Every time we enter the loop, we add a 1 to the end of the list that we are iterating through. As a result, we never make it to the end of the list! It keeps growing!

A loop that never terminates is called an infinite loop. These are very dangerous for your code!

A program that hits an infinite loop often becomes completely unusable. The best course of action is to never write an infinite loop.

Note: If you accidentally stumble into an infinite loop while developing on your own machine, you can end the loop by using control + c to terminate the program. If you’re writing code in our online editor, you’ll need to refresh the page to get out of an infinite loop!

students_period_A = ["Alex", "Briana", "Cheri", "Daniele"]
students_period_B = ["Dora", "Minerva", "Alexa", "Obie"]

for student in students_period_A:
  students_period_B.append(student)
  #if you change B to A, you'll get an infinite loop
  print(student)
