Break
We often want to use a for loop to search through a list for some value:

items_on_sale = ["blue_shirt", "striped_socks", "knit_dress", "red_headband", "dinosaur_onesie"]

# we want to check if the item with ID "knit_dress" is on sale:
for item in items_on_sale:
  if item == "knit_dress":
    print("Knit Dress is on sale!")
This code goes through each item in items_on_sale and checks for a match. After we find that "knit_dress" is in the list items_on_sale, we don’t need to go through the rest of the items_on_sale list. Since it’s only 5 elements long, iterating through the entire list is not a big deal in this case. But what if items_on_sale had 1000 items after "knit_dress"? What if it had 100,000 items after "knit_dress"?

You can stop a for loop from inside the loop by using break. When the program hits a break statement, control returns to the code outside of the for loop. For example:

items_on_sale = ["blue_shirt", "striped_socks", "knit_dress", "red_headband", "dinosaur_onesie"]

print("Checking the sale list!")
for item in items_on_sale:
  print(item)
  if item == "knit_dress":
    break
print("End of search!")
This would produce the output:

Checking the sale list!
blue_shirt
striped_socks
knit_dress
End of search!
We didn’t need to check "red_headband" or "dinosaur_onesie" at all!


Continue
When we’re iterating through lists, we may want to skip some values. Let’s say we want to print out all of the numbers in a list, unless they’re negative. We can use continue to move to the next i in the list:

big_number_list = [1, 2, -1, 4, -5, 5, 2, -9]

for i in big_number_list:
  if i < 0:
    continue
  print(i)
This would produce the output:

1
2
4
5
2
Every time there was a negative number, the continue keyword moved the index to the next value in the list, without executing the code in the rest of the for loop.

Your computer is the doorman at a bar in a country where the drinking age is 21.

Loop through the ages list. If an entry is less than 21, skip it and move to the next entry. Otherwise, print the age.

ages = [12, 38, 34, 26, 21, 19, 67, 41, 17]
for age in ages:
  if age < 21:
    continue
  print(age)
